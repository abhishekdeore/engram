# Cross-LLM Memory Service — Implementation Log

> **Purpose**: Canonical record of what was built, what was broken, and what was fixed in each phase. Intended as a reference for future development and onboarding.

---

## Phase 0 — Schema & Infrastructure

### Goal
Establish the Neo4j graph schema, project scaffolding, and tooling before any application code is written.

### What Was Implemented

#### Project Scaffolding
- `pyproject.toml` — project definition using `hatchling` build backend, Python ≥ 3.11, `uv` as package manager
- Source layout: `src/memory/` package with submodules for API, auth, config, db, models, services
- Dev dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`, `anyio`

#### Configuration (`src/memory/config.py`)
- `Settings(BaseSettings)` backed by `pydantic-settings`, reads from `.env`
- Fields: `neo4j_uri`, `neo4j_username`, `neo4j_password`, `neo4j_database`, connection pool size, timeout, JWT settings, OpenAI API key (Phase 2 placeholder), Redis URL (Phase 2 placeholder)
- Properties: `is_development`, `is_production`

#### Database Connection (`src/memory/db/connection.py`)
- Sync driver singleton (`get_driver` / `close_driver` / `verify_connectivity`) — used by scripts
- Async driver singleton (`get_async_driver` / `close_async_driver` / `verify_async_connectivity`) — used by FastAPI
- Both configured with pool size and connection timeout from settings

#### Schema Setup (`scripts/setup_schema.py`)
Applies 16 DDL statements to Neo4j, all using `IF NOT EXISTS` (fully idempotent).
A pre-flight step drops `index_segment_conversation_order` if it exists in the database — that plain index covers the same columns as `constraint_segment_conversation_index`, and Neo4j will refuse to create the constraint while the plain index is present (see Bug P0-3 below).

| # | Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|------|------|---------|
| 1 | `constraint_user_id` | Unique constraint | `User.userId` |
| 2 | `constraint_conversation_id` | Unique constraint | `Conversation.conversationId` |
| 3 | `constraint_message_id` | Unique constraint | `Message.messageId` |
| 4 | `constraint_segment_id` | Unique constraint | `Segment.segmentId` |
| 5 | `constraint_chunk_id` | Unique constraint | `Chunk.chunkId` |
| 6 | `constraint_segment_conversation_index` | Composite unique constraint | `(Segment.conversationId, Segment.segmentIndex)` — prevents duplicate segments; its backing index also serves as the segment ordering index *(added during Phase 1 review)* |
| 7 | `index_conversation_user_date` | Composite index | `(Conversation.userId, Conversation.startedAt)` — date pre-filter |
| 8 | `index_message_user_timestamp` | Composite index | `(Message.userId, Message.timestamp)` |
| 9 | `index_message_conversation` | Index | `Message.conversationId` |
| 10 | `index_segment_conversation` | Index | `Segment.conversationId` |
| 11 | `index_chunk_message` | Index | `Chunk.messageId` |
| 12 | `index_message_conversation_index` | Composite index | `(Message.conversationId, Message.messageIndex)` — segment range queries *(added during Phase 1 review)* |
| 13 | `index_vector_segment` | Vector index | `Segment.embedding` (1536 dims, cosine) — Phase 2 |
| 14 | `index_vector_message` | Vector index | `Message.embedding` (1536 dims, cosine) — Phase 2 |
| 15 | `index_vector_chunk` | Vector index | `Chunk.embedding` (1536 dims, cosine) — Phase 2 |
| 16 | `index_fulltext_message` | Full-text index | `Message.content` — keyword fallback search |

#### Schema Verification (`scripts/verify_schema.py`)
- Reads `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` and `SHOW INDEXES` from Neo4j
- Checks existence and type of each expected schema object
- Prints a pass/fail table using `rich`

#### Sample Data Seeding (`scripts/seed_sample_data.py`)
- Creates representative User, Conversation, Message, and Segment nodes
- Demonstrates the verbatim storage model with real-looking conversation data

### Phase 0 Bugs Encountered & Fixed

#### Bug P0-1 — `verify_schema.py` reported all constraints as `state=N/A`
- **Root cause**: Neo4j 2026.x removed the `state` column from `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`. Constraints are either present or absent — there is no intermediate `ONLINE`/`POPULATING` state for constraints.
- **Fix**: Rewrote constraint verification to check existence and type only. Removed all `state == "ONLINE"` checks.

#### Bug P0-2 — `seed_sample_data.py` raised `TypeError` on full-text search
- **Root cause**: `session.run(QUERY, query=query_text)` — the keyword argument name `query` collided with the neo4j driver's own `session.run(query=...)` parameter.
- **Fix**: Renamed the Cypher parameter from `$query` to `$searchText` and the keyword argument accordingly.

#### Bug P0-3 — `constraint_segment_conversation_index` could not be created while a regular index covered the same columns
- **Root cause**: `index_segment_conversation_order` (a plain composite index on `Segment.conversationId, Segment.segmentIndex`) was applied to the database before `constraint_segment_conversation_index` (a composite uniqueness constraint on the same two properties) was added to the schema. Neo4j requires that no existing index covers the constraint columns — if one is present, constraint creation raises `Neo.ClientError.Schema.IndexAlreadyExists` and the statement is skipped. Because `setup_schema.py` uses `IF NOT EXISTS` (which suppresses `AlreadyExists` errors for constraints, not for this conflict), the constraint was silently absent from the database even though setup reported success.
- **Impact**: Without the constraint, the MERGE-based duplicate-segment prevention (Bug P1-5 fix) provided no database-level safety guarantee. Concurrent writes to the same conversation could still create two Segment nodes at the same `segmentIndex`.
- **Fix**:
  1. Removed `index_segment_conversation_order` from `SCHEMA_STATEMENTS` entirely. The constraint's own backing index covers `(conversationId, segmentIndex)` and provides equivalent query performance — the separate index is redundant.
  2. Added a pre-flight `DROP INDEX index_segment_conversation_order IF EXISTS` step at the top of `main()` in `setup_schema.py`. This handles existing databases that already have the plain index without manual intervention.
  3. Removed `index_segment_conversation_order` from the expected set in `test_connection.py::test_neo4j_composite_indexes_exist` (the constraint's backing index has the constraint name, not the old index name).

---

## Phase 1 — Write API

### Goal
Build the HTTP write pipeline: accept conversation batches in Canonical Message Format (CMF), return `202 Accepted` immediately, and persist everything verbatim to Neo4j as a background task.

### What Was Implemented

#### Data Models (`src/memory/models/`)

**`message.py` — `MessageIn`**
```
messageId   : str        (min 1 char)
role        : "user" | "assistant"
content     : str        (min 1 char)
timestamp   : AwareDatetime  (timezone-aware, Pydantic v2)
tokenCount  : int        (≥ 0)
```

**`requests.py`**
- `WriteRequest` — full conversation payload; validates `provider` against a `ProviderType` Literal (`chatgpt`, `claude`, `gemini`, `grok`, `copilot`)
- `WriteResponse` — `{ status: "accepted", messageCount, conversationId }`
- `TokenRequest` / `TokenResponse` — dev-only token issuance
- `HealthResponse`

#### Auth (`src/memory/auth/jwt_handler.py`)
- `create_access_token(user_id)` — issues a signed JWT with `sub`, `iat`, `exp`
- `decode_access_token(token)` — verifies signature and expiry, returns `sub`
- Algorithm: HS256; secret and TTL from settings

#### FastAPI Application (`src/memory/api/main.py`)
- `@asynccontextmanager lifespan` — creates the async Neo4j driver on startup, verifies connectivity (fails fast), closes explicitly on shutdown (Neo4j 6.x requires explicit close — `__del__` no longer closes)
- CORS: permissive in development, locked down in production
- Routers: `health`, `auth`, `memory`

#### Routes
- `GET /health` — checks Neo4j connectivity, returns `{ status: "ok", neo4j: "connected" }`
- `POST /auth/token` — DEV ONLY; issues a JWT; blocked in production via `settings.is_production`
- `POST /memory/write` — validates JWT, checks `userId` matches token, enqueues background write, returns `202` immediately

#### Write Service (`src/memory/services/write_service.py`)
Pipeline executed as a `BackgroundTask`:
1. MERGE `User` node (create or update `lastActiveAt`)
2. MERGE `Conversation` node + link to User
3. Atomic message write (see details below)
4. Increment `Conversation.messageCount` by actual new messages only
5. Trigger segmentation check

#### Segment Service (`src/memory/services/segment_service.py`)
Hub-and-spoke segmentation model:
- One `Segment` per 20 messages (`SEGMENT_SIZE = 20`)
- Segment content = verbatim concatenation: `ROLE [timestamp]: content\n...`
- `Segment` linked to `Conversation` via `HAS_SEGMENT`
- Each `Message` linked to its `Segment` via `CONTAINS_MESSAGE {order}`
- Consecutive segments linked via `NEXT_SEGMENT`

### Phase 1 Bugs Encountered & Fixed

---

#### Bug P1-1 — Test expected 403 for missing auth, got 401

- **Root cause**: FastAPI's `HTTPBearer` dependency returns `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` when the `Authorization` header is absent or malformed. `HTTP 403 Forbidden` is the correct code when a user is *authenticated but not authorised* (e.g., `userId` mismatch). The test had confused the two.
- **Fix**: Changed test assertion from `assert resp.status_code == 403` to `assert resp.status_code == 401` for both the missing-token and invalid-token cases.

---

#### Bug P1-2 — Idempotent resend created 4 messages instead of 2

- **Root cause**: The `HAS_MESSAGE` relationship was created with an `order` property: `MERGE (c)-[:HAS_MESSAGE {order: $messageIndex}]->(m)`. On a resend, the second write computed `messageIndex = 2` (because 2 messages already existed), so `{order: 2}` didn't match the existing `{order: 0}` relationship. Neo4j's MERGE saw no match and created a **second** `HAS_MESSAGE` relationship pointing to the same `Message` node — making the conversation appear to have 4 messages.
- **Fix**: Removed `{order: $messageIndex}` from the `HAS_MESSAGE` relationship pattern. `messageIndex` belongs on the `Message` node itself (`m.messageIndex`), not on the relationship. The relationship carries no properties: `MERGE (c)-[:HAS_MESSAGE]->(m)`.

---

#### Bug P1-3 — TOCTOU race condition on messageIndex assignment

- **Root cause**: `_get_message_count_tx` executed inside `session.execute_read()` and returned `current_count` to Python. `_write_messages_tx` then ran in a **separate** `session.execute_write()`. Under Neo4j's MVCC, two concurrent write transactions for the same conversation could both read `current_count = N` before either wrote anything, then both assign indices `N, N+1, N+2...` — producing colliding `messageIndex` values on different `Message` nodes.
- **Why a simple patch was insufficient**: Moving the read *into* the write transaction via a plain `MATCH ... RETURN count(m)` still does not prevent the race, because Neo4j MVCC allows concurrent write transactions to both read the same snapshot count before either acquires a write lock.
- **Fix**: At the start of `_write_messages_tx`, issue `SET c.updatedAt = $now` **before** reading the message count. `SET` on a node forces Neo4j to acquire an exclusive write lock on the `Conversation` node. Any concurrent transaction attempting the same `SET` blocks until the first commits. After the first commits, the second reads the updated count — serialising index assignment correctly.

---

#### Bug P1-4 — `Conversation.messageCount` inflated on duplicate sends

- **Root cause**: `_merge_conversation_tx` used `ON MATCH SET c.messageCount = c.messageCount + $incomingCount`. This blindly added the incoming batch size on every call regardless of how many messages were actually new. On a full resend where all `messageId`s already existed, MERGE created no new Message nodes, but `messageCount` was still incremented by the full batch size.
- **Why a simple patch was insufficient**: Simply moving the increment elsewhere still requires knowing the *actual* new count, not the incoming count.
- **Fix**:
  1. `_merge_conversation_tx` sets `messageCount = 0` on `ON CREATE` and does **not touch** `messageCount` on `ON MATCH`.
  2. `_write_messages_tx` sets `m._isNew = true` in `ON CREATE SET` for each newly created `Message` node.
  3. After the UNWIND, collect all `(messageId, isNew)` records and count `isNew == true` entries → `actual_new_count`.
  4. A new `_bump_conversation_count_tx` increments `c.messageCount` by `actual_new_count` only. Called only when `actual_new_count > 0`.
  5. The `_isNew` sentinel is cleaned up in the same transaction via a second UNWIND.

---

#### Bug P1-5 — Duplicate Segment nodes on concurrent writes

- **Root cause**: `_create_segment_tx` used `CREATE (s:Segment {...})`, generating a new `segmentId` (UUID) on every call. Two concurrent writes to the same conversation could both pass the `complete_segments_needed > existing_segments` check, then both `CREATE` a Segment at the same `segmentIndex` with different UUIDs. The `constraint_segment_id` uniqueness constraint on `segmentId` did not prevent this because each call used a different UUID.
- **Why a simple patch was insufficient**: Adding a guard check ("does this segment already exist?") before `CREATE` still has a TOCTOU window between the check and the create. The only safe fix is a database-enforced constraint combined with `MERGE`.
- **Fix**:
  1. Added `constraint_segment_conversation_index`: composite uniqueness constraint on `(Segment.conversationId, Segment.segmentIndex)` in `setup_schema.py`.
  2. Changed `CREATE` to `MERGE (s:Segment {conversationId: $conversationId, segmentIndex: $segIndex}) ON CREATE SET ...`. The MERGE serialises on the composite key — the second concurrent call matches the already-created node and executes no `ON CREATE`, leaving the segment unchanged.

---

#### Bug P1-6 — N+1 Cypher queries for message writes and CONTAINS_MESSAGE links

- **Root cause**: Both `_write_messages_tx` (one `tx.run()` per message) and the `CONTAINS_MESSAGE` loop in `_create_segment_tx` (one `tx.run()` per message per segment) issued O(N) separate round-trips inside a single transaction. For a 20-message segment this meant ~40 Cypher calls per write.
- **Fix**: Replaced both loops with `UNWIND`-based batch queries:
  - Message writes: one `tx.run()` with `UNWIND $messages AS msg MERGE (m:Message ...) ON CREATE SET ...`
  - NEXT_MESSAGE chain: one `tx.run()` with `UNWIND $pairs AS pair MERGE (a)-[:NEXT_MESSAGE]->(b)`
  - CONTAINS_MESSAGE links: one `tx.run()` with `UNWIND $messageItems AS item MERGE (s)-[:CONTAINS_MESSAGE {order: item.order}]->(m)`
  - Result: 5 `tx.run()` calls per write batch (lock+count, UNWIND merge, chain, cross-batch link, sentinel cleanup) vs ~40 previously.

---

#### Bug P1-7 — `Conversation.segmentCount` driven by unreliable increment

- **Root cause**: `SET c.segmentCount = c.segmentCount + 1` was called inside `_create_segment_tx`. With the `CREATE`→`MERGE` fix, a second concurrent call matches the existing Segment and does not execute `ON CREATE`, but **does** still reach the `segmentCount + 1` line — incrementing an already-correct counter. Additionally, if a prior write had failed mid-transaction leaving the counter in an incorrect state, it could never self-correct.
- **Fix**: Replaced the increment with a direct count of actual `Segment` nodes:
  ```cypher
  MATCH (c:Conversation {conversationId: $convId})
  OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[:HAS_SEGMENT]->(s:Segment)
  WITH c, count(s) AS actualCount
  SET c.segmentCount = actualCount
  ```
  This is always accurate regardless of prior state or concurrent writes.

---

#### Bug P1-8 — Backwards NEXT_MESSAGE edge on idempotent resend

- **Root cause**: The "connect first new message to last existing message" step used `base_offset` (the total message count at the start of the transaction) as the index of the previous message. On a resend, `base_offset` included the re-sent messages themselves, so `base_offset - 1` pointed to the *last* message in the re-sent batch rather than the last message *before* the batch. This caused a backward `last→first` edge to be MERGEd in addition to the correct `first→second` chain.
- **Fix**: The chain-connection step is gated on whether `messages[0]` is actually new, determined by checking if its `messageId` is in `new_ids` (the set of IDs that had `_isNew = true` after the UNWIND). If `messages[0]` already existed, no chain-connection attempt is made.

---

#### Bug P1-9 — Test cleanup using the global driver singleton

- **Root cause**: The `cleanup_test_data` fixture in `test_write_api.py` called `get_driver()` (the module-level singleton from `connection.py`) then `close_driver()` after tests completed. This set `_sync_driver = None`, coupling test teardown to the application's driver lifecycle. Any test module running after this one would silently re-create the singleton.
- **Fix**: The cleanup fixture now creates its own isolated `GraphDatabase.driver(...)` using settings credentials and closes it in a `finally` block. It never touches the application singleton.

---

| **Total** | **34** | |

## Phase 2 — Embedding Pipeline & Semantic Query

### Goal
Add a semantic retrieval path: embed conversations using OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, store vectors in Neo4j, and expose `POST /memory/query` for ranked, token-budget-aware memory retrieval. Full-text keyword search is always available as a fallback. Zero hallucination risk — the pipeline never calls a generative model.

### What Was Implemented

#### New Models (`src/memory/models/requests.py`)
- `QueryRequest` — validated query payload with date filtering, topK, tokenBudget, optional provider filter
  - `date` and `dateFrom/dateTo` are mutually exclusive (Pydantic `model_validator`)
  - `effective_date_from` / `effective_date_to` properties resolve both forms to a canonical date range
- `MessageResult` — verbatim message turn (messageId, role, content, timestamp, tokenCount)
- `ConversationResult` — grouped messages from one conversation with relevance score
- `QueryResponse` — full response: results, totalResults, tokenCount, queryLatencyMs, dateFilterApplied, searchMode

#### Embedding Service (`src/memory/services/embedding_service.py`)
Complete vectorisation pipeline:
- `embed_new_content(driver, openai_client, redis_client, conversation_id)` — called as final step of write BackgroundTask; no-op if `openai_client` is None
- `get_query_embedding(openai_client, redis_client, query_text)` — used by query pipeline; returns None on failure (never raises)
- **Idempotency**: only embeds nodes where `embedding IS NULL` — safe to retry
- **Caching**: Redis keyed by `SHA-256(content)`, TTL 3600s; fully optional (graceful degradation if Redis absent or unreachable)
- **Long content handling**: content > 8191 tokens → head+tail averaging (first 4096 + last 4096 tokens), then L2-normalise → deterministic, no generative model involved
- **Chunk nodes**: messages > 512 tokens → 512-token windows with 100-token overlap → `Chunk` nodes linked via `HAS_CHUNK`; chunk vector search always returns the parent `Message`, never the chunk itself
- **Token counting**: `tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")` — exact token counts matching OpenAI's tokeniser

#### Query Service (`src/memory/services/query_service.py`)
8-step retrieval pipeline:
1. **Date pre-filter** (parallel with step 2) — query `(Conversation.userId, Conversation.startedAt)` composite index; returns candidate `conversationId` set; empty set + date filter = early return (zero results)
2. **Query embedding** (parallel with step 1) — embed query text; `None` if OpenAI unavailable
3. **Three parallel vector searches** — separate Neo4j sessions for Segment, Message, and Chunk indexes via `asyncio.gather`; oversampling `topK × 10` before `userId` post-filter (MVCC limitation workaround)
4. **Deduplicate** by `messageId`, keep highest cosine score
5. **Context expansion** — fetch ±2 neighbours per matched message via `messageIndex` range
6. **Ranking** — two modes:
   - No date filter: `0.7×cosine + 0.2×recency + 0.1×context_bonus`
   - Date filter: `0.8×cosine + 0.1×date_match + 0.1×context_bonus`
   - Recency: piecewise linear decay (0d→1.0, 7d→0.9, 30d→0.7, 90d→0.5, 365+d→0.2)
7. **Token-budget assembly** — skip messages that would exceed budget; never truncates mid-message; group by conversation
8. **Return** `QueryResponse` with `searchMode: "vector" | "fulltext" | "empty"`
- **Full-text fallback**: triggered when no vector hits ≥ 0.70 threshold, or when OpenAI is unavailable

#### Write Service (`src/memory/services/write_service.py`) — Updated
- Signature extended: `write_conversation_to_graph(driver, request, openai_client=None, redis_client=None)`
- Step 7 added (after segmentation): `await embed_new_content(...)` — completely optional; verbatim storage (Phase 1) is already committed before this runs

#### API Layer Updates
- `src/memory/api/main.py` — lifespan now initialises three clients: Neo4j (required, fail-fast), OpenAI (optional if `OPENAI_API_KEY` set), Redis (optional if `REDIS_URL` set); shutdown closes all open connections
- `src/memory/api/dependencies.py` — added `get_openai_client`, `get_redis_client` accessors + `OpenAIClient`, `RedisClient` type aliases
- `src/memory/api/routes/memory.py` — write route now injects and forwards `openai_client` and `redis_client` to background task
- `src/memory/api/routes/query.py` — new file; `POST /memory/query`; same JWT + userId-match guard as write route

---

### Phase 2 Bugs Encountered & Fixed

#### Bug P2-1 — `_embed_long_or_short` referenced but not defined

- **Root cause**: In `_embed_segments`, the loop called `await _embed_long_or_short(...)` — a function name that was planned during design but never written. The long/short branching for segments is already handled inside `_call_openai_embedding` (which checks token count and delegates to `_head_tail_embedding` when needed). The named helper was a dead reference.
- **Fix**: Replaced `_embed_long_or_short(openai_client, redis_client, text=..., token_count=...)` with `_get_or_compute_embedding(openai_client, redis_client, content)`. The `token_count` variable was also removed as it became unused.

#### Bug P2-2 — Cypher `NOT IN` syntax rejected by Neo4j 2026.x

- **Root cause**: The context expansion query used `AND neighbor.messageId NOT IN $messageIds`. Neo4j 2026.x (Bolt 6.x) no longer accepts `NOT IN` as a compound infix operator in a `WHERE` clause.
- **Fix**: Changed to `AND NOT (neighbor.messageId IN $messageIds)`, which is valid in all supported Neo4j versions.

#### Bug P2-3 — `all()` predicate removed in Neo4j 2026.x

- **Root cause**: `test_long_message_produces_chunk_nodes` used `all(ch.embedding IS NOT NULL)` in a `RETURN` clause. The `all()` list predicate function was removed in Neo4j 2026.x.
- **Fix** (test-only): Replaced with `count(ch.embedding) = count(ch) AS allEmbedded`. `count(property)` counts non-null values; comparing it to `count(node)` (which counts all) is equivalent.

#### Bug P2-4 — Date filter with zero matches not returning empty results

- **Root cause**: When `_date_prefilter_tx` returned an empty list (no conversations matched the date range), `_candidate_filter_clause` returned an empty string (no filter), so the vector searches ran against **all** conversations for that user, ignoring the date filter entirely.
- **Fix**: After `asyncio.gather(candidate_ids_task, embed_task)`, added an early-return guard: if `request.has_date_filter and len(candidate_ids) == 0`, immediately return an empty `QueryResponse(searchMode="empty")`.

## Pre-Phase 3 Audit — Cross-Phase Review Findings

Conducted after Phases 0, 1, and 2 were complete. The goal was to verify the three phases function correctly as a connected system. The review found bugs that exist in live code but are silent — no test fails, no exception is raised, no error is logged.

| P3-PRE-7 | **P1 — Fix before Phase 3** | ✅ Fixed | No end-to-end write→embed→query integration test |
| P3-PRE-8 | **P2 — Fix during Phase 3** | ✅ Fixed | Version drift: `__init__.py` reports `0.1.0`, `main.py` declares `0.2.0` |
| P3-PRE-9 | **P2 — Fix during Phase 3** | ✅ Fixed | JWT secret key has no production-safety validator in `Settings` |
| P3-PRE-10 | **P3 — Technical debt** | ✅ Fixed | Dead async driver singleton in `db/connection.py` never used by FastAPI |
| P3-PRE-11 | **P3 — Technical debt** | ✅ Fixed | `_candidate_filter_clause` hardcodes alias `node`; breaks on future search paths |

### Bug P3-PRE-1 — `Conversation.totalTokens` inflates on every duplicate send

- **Root cause**: `_merge_conversation_tx` uses `ON MATCH SET c.totalTokens = c.totalTokens + $incomingTokens`. `incomingTokens` is the sum of ALL tokens in the incoming batch, including tokens for messages that already exist. Unlike `messageCount` (which was fixed in P1-4 using the `_isNew` sentinel), `totalTokens` was never given the same treatment.
- **Impact**: After N resends of the same conversation, `totalTokens = N × actual_token_count`. Corrupts billing, analytics, and any downstream feature that reads this field.
- **Fix**: Extend `_write_messages_tx` to sum `tokenCount` over `new_ids` only, returning `(actual_new_count, actual_new_tokens)`. Pass `actual_new_tokens` to `_bump_conversation_count_tx` and also increment `c.totalTokens` there. Remove `totalTokens` from the `ON MATCH SET` in `_merge_conversation_tx`.

---

### Bug P3-PRE-2 — Long-message chunking path is not idempotent

- **Root cause**: `_get_unembedded_messages_tx` filters with `WHERE m.embedding IS NULL`. For messages longer than `CHUNK_THRESHOLD` tokens, the design intentionally stores `Message.embedding = NULL` and creates Chunk nodes instead. This means every subsequent call to `embed_new_content` re-fetches those long messages (still `NULL`), recomputes chunk embeddings via OpenAI, and overwrites existing chunk embeddings on MERGE MATCH.
- **Impact**: Every write to a conversation containing long messages makes redundant OpenAI API calls and wastes quota. The `test_embed_new_content_idempotent` test uses a 4-token message and does not catch this.
- **Fix**: Add `AND NOT EXISTS { MATCH (m)-[:HAS_CHUNK]->(:Chunk) }` to the WHERE clause in `_get_unembedded_messages_tx`. Add a dedicated test: long message, call `embed_new_content` twice, verify OpenAI is called exactly once.

---

### Bug P3-PRE-3 — `providers` filter accepted but never applied

- **Root cause**: `QueryRequest.providers` is validated and present in the API contract. No search path in `query_service.py` applies it — not the segment search, message search, chunk search, fulltext fallback, or date pre-filter.
- **Impact**: A client sending `providers=["chatgpt"]` receives results from all providers. The API contract is broken silently.
- **Fix**: Add `AND (m.provider IN $providers OR $providers IS NULL)` (or equivalent) to all four search paths. Handle `providers=None` as "all providers" (no filter).

---

### Bug P3-PRE-4 — Embedding constants hardcoded, disconnected from `settings`

- **Root cause**: `config.py` defines `embedding_model`, `embedding_dimensions`, and `embedding_cache_ttl_seconds` as configurable settings. `embedding_service.py` defines `EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"`, `EMBEDDING_DIMS = 1536`, and `REDIS_TTL = 3600` as module-level constants and never imports from `settings`. Any change to `.env` is silently ignored by the service.
- **Impact**: The Phase 0 configuration contract is broken by Phase 2. Operators cannot change the embedding model via environment without modifying source code.
- **Fix**: Replace the three hardcoded constants with `settings.embedding_model`, `settings.embedding_dimensions`, and `settings.embedding_cache_ttl_seconds`.

---

### Bug P3-PRE-5 — Redis URL defaults to non-empty string

- **Root cause**: `config.py` declares `redis_url: str = Field(default="redis://localhost:6379")`. The lifespan guard is `if settings.redis_url:`. Because the default is never empty, every deployment that does not set `REDIS_URL` in `.env` attempts a Redis connection, fails, logs a warning, and silently degrades. There is no clean "I don't want Redis" signal.
- **Impact**: Noisy startup warnings on every local development run; no way to intentionally disable Redis caching without setting an env var.
- **Fix**: Change default to `redis_url: str = Field(default="")`. The existing `if settings.redis_url:` guard then works as intended.

---

### Bug P3-PRE-6 — `constraint_segment_conversation_index` not verified in tests, and blocked by a conflicting plain index in the live database

- **Root cause (test gap)**: `test_connection.py::test_neo4j_constraints_exist` checked five uniqueness constraints but omitted `constraint_segment_conversation_index`, which was added in Phase 1 to fix Bug P1-5. Also missing: `index_message_conversation_index` in the composite index test.
- **Root cause (DB conflict)**: A plain composite index `index_segment_conversation_order` was created on `(Segment.conversationId, Segment.segmentIndex)` in a prior schema run. Neo4j refuses to create a uniqueness constraint on the same columns while that index exists. `setup_schema.py` silently skipped the constraint creation (the error was logged but the exit code was 0), leaving the database without the constraint. Full details in Bug P0-3 above.
- **Impact**: Without the constraint, the MERGE-based duplicate-segment prevention had no database-level enforcement. Tests gave a false green on a misconfigured DB.
- **Fix**:
  1. Added `constraint_segment_conversation_index` to `test_neo4j_constraints_exist` and `index_message_conversation_index` to `test_neo4j_composite_indexes_exist`.
  2. Removed the redundant `index_segment_conversation_order` from `SCHEMA_STATEMENTS` and added a pre-flight DROP in `setup_schema.py` (see Bug P0-3 for full details).

---

### Bug P3-PRE-7 — No end-to-end write→embed→query integration test

- **Root cause**: All Phase 2 tests seed Neo4j directly, bypassing the write pipeline entirely. There is no test that exercises the full cross-phase flow: `POST /memory/write` → BackgroundTask fires → embeddings land in Neo4j → `POST /memory/query` returns the written conversation.
- **Impact**: If `write_service.py` and `embedding_service.py` become misaligned (e.g., `userId` propagation, `tokenCount` conventions, `segmentId` naming), no test catches it.
- **Fix**: Add `TestEndToEnd` class in a new `tests/test_end_to_end.py` file. Write a conversation via the FastAPI TestClient (BackgroundTasks run synchronously), mock OpenAI to return a fixed embedding, then query with the same embedding and verify verbatim content is returned.

---

## Phase 3 — Read API, Delete API, Provider Adapters, Rate Limiting & Observability

### Goal
Complete the server-side API surface to make the service usable by browser extensions and LLM plugins: expose read/list/delete endpoints, implement cross-provider conversation normalizers, add per-user rate limiting, and add observability (correlation IDs, production safety validators).

### What Was Implemented

#### Pre-Phase 3 debt fixed before new features

**P3-PRE-8 — Version drift resolved**
Bumped `src/memory/__init__.py` from `0.1.0` → `0.3.0` and `main.py` app version + root endpoint from `0.2.0` → `0.3.0`. All three now agree.

**P3-PRE-9 — Production JWT safety validator**
Added `_INSECURE_JWT_DEFAULTS` set and `@model_validator(mode="after")` `_validate_production_safety` in `Settings`. When `app_env == "production"`, startup raises `ValueError` if `jwt_secret_key` is in the known-weak set or shorter than 32 characters. Fail-fast is the only safe default: a misconfigured secret makes every token forgeable with no observable error.

**P3-PRE-10 — Dead async driver singleton removed**
`db/connection.py` contained `get_async_driver`, `close_async_driver`, `verify_async_connectivity`, and the `_async_driver` global. FastAPI has always used `app.state.neo4j_driver` set in the lifespan context manager. The singleton was never called, never tested, and could not work with the async lifespan anyway. Removed entirely. Module docstring added to explain the driver ownership model.

**P3-PRE-11 — `_candidate_filter_clause` alias parameter**
The function hardcoded the alias `node`. Added `alias: str = "node"` parameter so it is consistent with `_provider_filter_clause` and safe to use on future search paths that bind the node under a different name.

---

#### Rate Limiting (`src/memory/api/limiter.py` — new file)

Extracted `Limiter` and `_rate_limit_key` into a standalone module to break the circular import between `main.py` (which imports route modules) and route modules (which need the limiter).

Key function strategy (three tiers):
1. `request.state.authenticated_user_id` if already set (post-auth path) — most precise
2. Decode Bearer JWT from `Authorization` header without verifying — so the rate bucket is per-user even before the FastAPI dependency runs; prevents all test traffic from sharing one IP bucket
3. Fall back to `get_remote_address` for unauthenticated endpoints (`/health`, etc.)

Rate limits are configured via `settings.rate_limit_write_per_minute` and `settings.rate_limit_query_per_minute`. Defaults are 600/600 — intentionally permissive for development and testing. Operators lower them via `.env` in production. Note: slowapi uses in-process counters; with `--workers > 1` each worker has an independent counter, so the effective limit becomes `limit × workers`. Use `workers=1` for exact limiting, or switch to a Redis-backed limiter.

---

#### Read Service (`src/memory/services/read_service.py` — new file)

- `list_conversations(driver, user_id, provider, limit, offset, date_from, date_to)` — two Cypher queries in the same session: one `COUNT(*)` for pagination total, one paginated row query ordered by `startedAt DESC`. Supports optional provider filter and ISO date range. Returns `ListConversationsResponse`.
- `get_conversation(driver, conversation_id, user_id)` — MATCH includes `userId` predicate so cross-user access returns None (404) identically to not-found. Messages ordered by `messageIndex ASC` for chronological output.

---

#### Delete Service (`src/memory/services/delete_service.py` — new file)

- `delete_conversation(driver, conversation_id, user_id)` — verifies ownership with a MATCH that includes userId; if not found, returns None (no information leak). Deletion order: Chunks → Messages → Segments → Conversation (avoids Neo4j orphan-node constraint issues). All deletes use DETACH DELETE.
- `delete_user_data(driver, user_id)` — GDPR erasure in 5 steps matching the same cascade order; counts nodes deleted per step; deletes the User node last. Returns total `nodesDeleted` count.

---

#### Read/Delete Routes (`src/memory/api/routes/memory.py` — extended)

Added four endpoints to the existing `memory.py` router:

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/memory/conversations` | JWT | Paginated list; supports `provider`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `limit`, `offset` query params. Rejects `dateTo` without `dateFrom` (422). |
| `GET` | `/memory/conversation/{conversationId}` | JWT | Full verbatim conversation; 404 for not-found or cross-user. |
| `DELETE` | `/memory/conversation/{conversationId}` | JWT | Delete conversation + cascade; 404 for not-found or cross-user; 200 with `DeleteResponse`. |
| `DELETE` | `/memory/user/{userId}` | JWT | GDPR purge; 403 if path userId ≠ token userId. |

Write endpoint (`POST /memory/write`) updated: added `@limiter.limit(_WRITE_RATE)` decorator and `request: Request` parameter so the rate-limit key function can access `request.state`.

---

#### Query Route (`src/memory/api/routes/query.py` — updated)

Added `@limiter.limit(_QUERY_RATE)` decorator and `request: Request` parameter. Sets `request.state.authenticated_user_id = current_user_id` so the rate-limit key function uses the correct per-user bucket.

---

#### Provider Adapters (`src/memory/adapters/` — new package)

Five concrete adapter classes and a dispatch normalizer that convert each provider's native export format to Canonical Message Format (CMF).

All adapters:
- Are pure functions with no I/O.
- Use `SHA-256(conversationId:role:index)` for deterministic, idempotent `messageId` generation.
- Filter out system/tool/function roles — only `user` and `assistant` pass through.
- Filter empty content (post-process defense-in-depth in `normalizer.py`).

| Adapter | Input formats | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `chatgpt.py` | Chat Completions API response, `conversations.json` mapping format | `_extract_text` handles both plain string and `{"content_type": "text", "parts": [...]}` dicts |
| `claude.py` | `type="message"` API response, `history[]` array format | Content block arrays joined with newline |
| `gemini.py` | `candidates[]` (generateContent), `contents[]` history | `"model"` role mapped → `"assistant"` |
| `grok.py` | OpenAI-compatible format | `grok-` prefixed IDs; maps `completion_tokens` to last assistant turn |
| `copilot.py` | VS Code `requests[]` format (timestamp in ms), generic `turns[]` format | `copilot-` prefixed IDs |

`normalizer.py` — `normalize(raw, provider)` dispatch; raises `AdapterError` for unknown provider; `supported_providers()` returns sorted list of valid provider strings.

---

#### Observability — Correlation ID Middleware

Added to `main.py`:
- Honours `X-Request-ID` from client if provided; generates UUID4 otherwise.
- Sanitizes: printable ASCII only, max 64 characters (prevents log injection).
- Attaches `request_id` to `request.state` and echoes it back in `X-Request-ID` response header.

---

#### New Response Models (`src/memory/models/requests.py`)

- `ConversationSummary` — fields: `conversationId`, `provider`, `model`, `messageCount`, `totalTokens`, `segmentCount`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `isComplete`
- `ListConversationsResponse` — `conversations: list[ConversationSummary]`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`
- `ConversationReadResponse` — full conversation with all messages in CMF
- `DeleteResponse` — `status`, `message`, `deletedId`, `nodesDeleted`

`ProviderType` Literal extended to include `"copilot"`.

---

#### Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)

Added `"slowapi>=0.1.9"`.

---

### Phase 3 Bugs Encountered & Fixed

#### Bug P3-1 — Circular import between `main.py` and route modules

- **Root cause**: `query.py` and `memory.py` originally imported `limiter` from `main.py`. `main.py` imports from `routes/`. Python's import system raises `ImportError` on the circular reference at startup.
- **Fix**: Extracted `limiter` and `_rate_limit_key` to `src/memory/api/limiter.py`. Both `main.py` and route files import from the new standalone module. No circular reference.

#### Bug P3-2 — Rate limiter exhausted test suite bucket

- **Root cause 1**: Default rate limit was 30/minute. `test_write_api.py` makes ~50–80 write requests per run, all as the same `TEST_USER_ID`.
- **Root cause 2**: `request.state.authenticated_user_id` is not set until the route body runs — after the `@limiter.limit` decorator has already determined the rate key. Without user ID in state, the fallback was `get_remote_address(request)` = `"testclient"`, collapsing all test users into one shared bucket.
- **Fix 1**: Updated `_rate_limit_key` to decode the JWT from the `Authorization` header when `authenticated_user_id` is not yet in state. Each user now has their own bucket from the first request.
- **Fix 2**: Changed default limits from 30/60 to 600/600 per minute. Intentionally permissive for dev/test; operators tighten via `.env`.

#### Bug P3-3 — `HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY` deprecation warning

- **Root cause**: FastAPI/Starlette renamed or deprecated the `status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY` constant export path. Using it emitted a deprecation warning.
- **Fix**: Replaced with the literal integer `422` in the `dateTo`-without-`dateFrom` guard in `memory.py`.

---

### Phase 3 Residual Risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| slowapi in-process counters | Medium | With `--workers > 1` effective limit = `limit × workers`. Use Redis-backed limiter for exact enforcement in production multi-worker deployments. |
| Provider adapter format assumptions | Low–Medium | Adapters are written against documented format snapshots. Providers change their export format without notice. Monitor and update when providers ship breaking changes. |
| Streaming responses not yet adapted | Low | All adapters assume complete conversations. Streaming SSE deltas from any provider are not handled. |
| Correlation ID trust boundary | Low | `X-Request-ID` is accepted from the client and echoed back. It is sanitized (printable ASCII, max 64 chars) but not validated for format. A caller could inject an arbitrary correlation ID into logs. Add format validation (UUID only) if log integrity matters. |
| GDPR erasure is synchronous | Low | `DELETE /memory/user/{userId}` runs a multi-step cascade synchronously in the request. For users with millions of nodes this could cause a timeout. Convert to background task with a status endpoint if needed. |

---

## Architecture Invariants (Never Violate)

1. **Zero hallucination** — the memory pipeline never calls a generative model at any stage. All stored content is verbatim input from the user.
2. **User-controlled storage** — writes happen only on explicit user trigger. The system never auto-captures conversations.
3. **Idempotent writes** — every write operation uses `MERGE` on a stable identifier (`messageId`, `conversationId`, `segmentIndex`). Re-sending the same data produces no duplicates and no state drift.
4. **Results consumed inside transactions** — all `tx.run()` result sets are fully consumed (`.data()` or `.single()`) before the transaction function returns. This is required by the Neo4j Python driver 6.x.
5. **Explicit driver lifecycle** — async drivers must be closed explicitly (`await driver.close()`). Do not rely on `__del__`; it no longer closes in Neo4j 6.x.
